# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    **ROOT CAUSES:**
    1. Package.json scripts đã bị đổi từ CRA sang Vite nhưng project thực tế là CRA với CRACO
    2. Environment variables sử dụng sai prefix (VITE_ thay vì REACT_APP_)
    3. Missing dependencies: dotenv, react-scripts
    4. App.js không có default export component
    
    **FIXES APPLIED:**
    1. ✅ Đổi package.json scripts về CRA: start -> craco start, build -> craco build
    2. ✅ Đổi .env variables về REACT_APP_ prefix (REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL)
    3. ✅ Sửa Dashboard.jsx sử dụng process.env.REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL
    4. ✅ Cài đặt missing dependencies: dotenv, react-scripts@5.0.1
    5. ✅ Tạo lại App.js với proper default export component (Dashboard wrapper)
    
    **RESULT:** 
    - Frontend compiled successfully và đang chạy trên http://localhost:3000

    **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:**
    The account creation functionality IS WORKING correctly. The issue is mail.tm API rate limiting (HTTP 429 errors) when creating multiple accounts rapidly.

    **DETAILED FINDINGS:**
    1. ✅ Single Account Creation: WORKS PERFECTLY - Successfully created account with email h6j3905gzm@2200freefonts.com

    4. ✅ Password Generation: Meets Garena requirements (12 chars, mixed case, digits, symbols)
    5. ✅ All Export Endpoints: TXT/CSV/XLSX working perfectly
    6. ❌ Rate Limiting: Mail.tm returns 429 'Too Many Requests' when creating accounts too quickly

    **SOLUTION:** Account creation works fine when done individually or with delays between requests. The 'cannot create account' issue is due to hitting mail.tm's rate limits, not a system bug."
